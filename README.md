# Spring Boot Reactive - Playground
This is a playground for illustrating the reactive concepts added to spring-boot since [Spring 5](https://spring.io/blog/2016/09/22/new-in-spring-5-functional-web-framework)
 
Before starting with spring-reactive I would recommend you to get an understanding about the concepts 
of reactive programming by reading [Notes on Reactive Programming](https://spring.io/blog/2016/06/07/notes-on-reactive-programming-part-i-the-reactive-landscape)
and the [Reactor 3 Reference Guide](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#intro-reactive). 

Feel free to use this project as a bootstrap for your spring-boot-reactive projects.
